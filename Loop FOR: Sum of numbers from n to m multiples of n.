Two numbers n and m are given. Find the sum of integers from n to m inclusive, multiples of n.
Write a function called sumMultN, which takes two numbers n, m and returns the sum of numbers from n to m multiple of n. In a solution, use the loop 'for'.

CODE:
function sumMultN(n, m){
let sum = 0;
for (let i = n; i <= m; i++) {
 if (i % n === 0) {
  sum += i;
 }
}
 return sum;
}
