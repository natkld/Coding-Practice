Two numbers n and m are given. Find the sum of all integers from n to m inclusive.
Write a function called sumFromNToM, which takes two numbers n, m and returns the sum of numbers from n to m. In a solution, use the loop 'for'.

CODE:
function sumFromNToM(n, m){
let sum = 0;
for ( let i = n; i <= m; i++) {
 sum += i;
}
 return sum;
}
